Rewards can be anything that your dog or puppy really wants and could include; food treats, a favourite toy, playing a certain game or getting a pat. However, really tasty treats will usually work best – try small pieces of dried liver, hotdog sausage, chicken or cheese for maximum effect. If you are using food treats, you will need to reduce the size of your dog's normal meals or use his whole meal divided up into smaller portions, to prevent your dog putting on weight. Always combine the giving of a reward with verbal praise such as \"Good dog\".";

Once he has the hang of the command, however, it’s a good idea to change the way you reward by only giving the reward every now and then, because this will make your dog try harder for it.

It is much easier to train a dog to do something else that you don’t mind, than to train him to completely stop something that you do not like. For example, if your dog jumps up at people, teach him a really good ‘sit’ command and ask for this when meeting others. \n" +
